Introduction:
The Digital Clock project is a simple yet practical application developed using JavaScript. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating in real-time.

Technologies Used:

HTML: The structure and layout of the digital clock are defined using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), providing the foundation for displaying content on the web page.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to apply custom styles and formatting to the clock's UI, including font styles, colors, and layout properties.
JavaScript: JavaScript is the primary programming language used to create the digital clock's functionality.
